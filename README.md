- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning (CNN)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Flask (if used)

## Features
- Detects leaf diseases from images
- Supports multiple plant types
- Provides disease classification results
- User-friendly interface

## How to Run the Project
1. Install Python on your system
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Install required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the application:
